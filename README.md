# Google-Colab-File-LSTM-Based-Text-Generation-Model
This project implements a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural network for text generation using PyTorch and NLTK. The model is trained on a dataset containing information about a Data Science Mentorship Program (DSMP 2023). It processes the input text, tokenizes it, and generates a sequence of words
